## Appendix

Task

Your task is to create a web application that allows users to authenticate via mobile phone number
(SMS code verification). Once authenticated, the user should be presented with a "Profile Page"
containing "Name" and "Email" fields and a "Save" button. The "Save" button must store the form
data in Firestore, using the phone number as the primary key. Ensure the form allows for the update
and saving of these fields, with validations in place for non-empty "Name" and a valid "Email".

Features to include:
1. Persistent user login across page refreshes and return visits.

2. A "Logout" button for user sign-out, with functionality to log back in and view previously entered data.
3. The application should be deployed under a secure HTTPS URL.
